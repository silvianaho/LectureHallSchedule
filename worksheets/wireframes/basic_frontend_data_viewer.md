### Justification 1
![Justificaiton1](assets/datagovsg.PNG)
Example page from data.gov.sg(https://data.gov.sg/dataset/civil-aircraft-arrivals-departures-passengers-and-mail-changi-airport-monthly?view_id=f1000da9-4036-4278-b241-eeec524ca229&resource_id=1a08ce4d-aafc-4fee-afb7-e8f4c3a41d80)<br/>
#### Good Points

1.Data.gov.sg data page has a very neat table<br/>
2.they use grey and white to separate each row, allowing the user to have a better view of the data. <br/>
3.there are only two color-dark blue and grey. Simple but pleasant to view.<br/>
#### Bad Points
1.the table is small and very concentred<br/>
2.would be better if there is more space in each cell<br/>
### Justification 2
![Justificaiton2](assets/kaggle.PNG)
Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/animal-crossing)<br/>
#### Good Points

1.Kaggle has the whole table fixed in with no pagination. <br/>
2.It saves time for the user, as they do not need to click on pages which may take time to load. <br/>
3.they used a theme color of blue.<br/>
#### Bad Points
1.the sidebar is higher than the main table.<br/>
2.without pagination it would be hard for the user to view the data at the back<br/>
### Justification 3

moh(https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics)<br/>
#### Good Points

 1.they use a dropdown so that they don’t have to do validation on the user’s input, saves time for coding. <br/>
 2.The reset button is good, the user doesn’t have to press backspace anymore.<br/>
 #### Bad Points
 1.One thing I don’t like about the page is the pagination colour<br/>
 2.current page colour is not very obvious, it could be better to have the whole bottom in another color as what data.gov.sg did<br/>
