#### Good Points

1. Very detailed and clear user input page.

3. Good validation check for the time, e.g. when the user keys in a value larger than 12, it will be auto corrected to 12.

#### Bad Points

1. It could be time consuming to do the validation and the auto correct.
2. The form is too small, input is all clustered together.
